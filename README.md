📝 Task Manager with Login and Signup Functionality

🚀 This project is built using React.js, Axios, and Material UI. It is a task manager application that allows users to create and manage their tasks, with the added functionality of login and signup for different users.

👥 The login and signup features ensure that each user has their own personalized experience, with their own set of tasks and data. This adds an extra layer of security to the application, making it safe and reliable.

📱 The application has a clean and user-friendly interface, designed using Material UI, which enhances the overall user experience. The use of React.js allows for dynamic and responsive rendering, making the application efficient and fast.

👨‍💻 To get started with the project, simply clone the repository and install the required dependencies. You can do this by running the following commands:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Attit11/task-manager-client.git
cd task-manager-client
npm install

🔑 To access the login and signup functionality, you will need to set up a backend server with appropriate authentication mechanisms. The application uses Axios to make API calls to the server, so ensure that the server is running and configured correctly.

🌟 Once everything is set up, you can start using the application and managing your tasks with ease!
